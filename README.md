MTA SA Area 69 Mission event script

This is a simple resource which spawns a lot of soldiers in area 69, spawns a pickup, which then stops the resource upon being picked up.
Feel free to edit to your own liking, i have not tested it in multiplayer. If you wish to stop the resource when the pickup gets picked up, uncomment 
stopResource ( rootResource) @ line 53 in area-server.
